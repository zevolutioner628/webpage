			<h1 class="letter-header-left";>Dear Gen Z,</h1>
			<p class="letter-content">
				It’s our time to rise up. America is not the country it was meant to be. Built on freedom and strong beliefs, we cannot protest without fearing our lives. Built to get away from a controlling government yet there’s practically nothing the rich people in power don’t control. The government is meant to stand with the people, not over it. Which is why we have decided it is time to start a revolution.
				We want to right the wrongs of the previous government, we’re going to repair the damage that has been done with the final goal of a just government free of corruption. 
			</p>

			<h2 class="letter-header-center";>Our Mission</h2>
			<p class="letter-content">
				The current government is flawed in many ways. Our plan is to fix these flaws and make America an overall better place to live. Here are some current flaws and ways we plan to solve them.
				We want to base this government on the ideals of equality, justice, and freedom. These ideals are important and needed for the country now and in the future.
			</p>

			<h3 class="letter-header-left">Equality</h3>
			<p class="letter-content">
				The current world is far from equality but the government is one of the many things holding it back. Whether it’s the wage gap, police brutality, hate crimes, or the vast lifestyle differences between the different financial classes, America is still a long way to go.
				One large example where the government is not helping solve equality is police brutality, something that has had a large impact on the country recently. The people in office who are supposed to be leading the country are not trying to solve the problem. The police officers who are supposed to be protecting us are attacking us for exercising our 1st amendment rights.				
				The media has an obvious bias towards the government and city officials. Even though police are attacking peaceful protesters, they are shown by the media as the victims.				
				During a pandemic or major event, the wealthy and powerful are allowed to hide in safety while others on the front lines have their lives on the line. They’re allowed to do whatever they want just because they have the money. Donald Trump ordered police to shoot rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters so he could take a picture outside. Celebrities in the COVID-19 pandemic were able to isolate with no large repercussions while other working-class families lost their jobs and lost their incomes. They can’t afford to not work.				
				The first step  to a revolution is acknowledgement, we need to acknowledge that most of us if not all of us are privileged. We can’t change the mindset of the nation but we can change the laws that allow things like this to happen. We can change the justice system to make sure people who commit hate crimes get what they deserve. 
			</p>

			<h3 class="letter-header-left">Justice</h3>
			<p class="letter-content">
				Our country is riddled with corruption, loopholes, and prejudice. These allow for unfair treatment within the justice system. The white and wealthy are more likely to escape punishment for the law. Statistics make it clear that those with privilege are treated better than the poor and minorities.
				Two people who commit the same crime should have the same punishment. Wealth, race, or gender should not have any effect on it. We can ensure that the justice system is as fair as possible by having low tolerance for those who break this standard. As we’ve seen with Derek Chauvin, the murderer of George Floyd, Chauvin was ‘excused’ from previous complaints, this is not okay.				
				Jail should also be rehabilitation, not punishment. People coming out of jail should not be angry or upset at the government, they should come out of jail feeling better about life and their path. Jails should have more funding to keep clean, safe, and pay for experts to help counsel felons on rehabilitation.
			</p>

			<h3 class="letter-header-left">Freedom</h3>
			<p class="letter-content">
				Many people in America, despite the ideal the country was built upon, are not free. The government is restraining too much. They say we have the freedom of peaceful protest yet shoot us when we exercise it. They say we have the freedom of media yet the media never shows the government as the bad guy.
				Trying to find videos or websites about things that make the government look bad is virtually impossible online. The only truly reliable source is first hand footage and testimony on social media.				
				We need a free media that won’t turn the other way when the government does something wrong.
			</p>

			<h2 class="letter-header-center">To Those Uncertain</h2>
			<p class="letter-content">
				Yes, this is big. Yes, we are young. But the time has come where we cannot sit in silence while the world crumbles down around us. We are tired of lies and coverups and corruption. We are tired of violence and prejudice and hate and people getting away with it. 
				We are doing our best to inform ourselves with the best and most reliable information possible. We will not spread misinformation or conspiracies, but we will not reject any theories that haven’t been disproven. Many of what are ‘reliable sources’ do not report on important issues of the government.				
				Even though we are young we are strong. We have strong ideas which are not clouded by our inexperience. Anything can be achievable with the right amount of effort, spirit, and planning. Statistics have shown that our generation is one of the most strong-minded, diverse, and ambitious generations. We can accomplish our dreams if we try.
			</p>
			<h2 class="letter-header-center">Our Goal</h2>
			<p class="letter-content">
				Our goal is to create a new set of laws that help equality, justice, and freedom. If the government is not willing to listen we are willing to take it to the next step. We are prepared to do whatever it takes to get them to listen.
				We are willing to advocate for this in whatever way possible. We are willing to storm social media and to protest in the streets. We are willing and capable to fight and keep fighting for what is right and just.				
				We are planning to create several acts which abolish old, flawed laws and implement new ones. Each of these acts will focus on a different part of society.
			</p>

			<h1 class="letter-header-left">So Generation Z,</h1>
			<p class="letter-content">
				If this interests you we suggest you join us. The only way we can make this happen is by standing together as one whole generation. The time of the old generation is done. The time of Generation Z has just begun.
				Our future. Our voice. Our choice.
			</p>

			<p class="letter-content-right">
				Sincerely, <br> The Zevolutioners
